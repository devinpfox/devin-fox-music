[Verse]
 Phone rings, I hit reply with a text
Seems like you just wanted more, wanted to see what was next
Send pics, I know you’re just tryna flex
I’ve seen this all before, it’s gonna turn to a mess
[Pre-Chorus]
 I’m not here for a fight
Just need you to shake me up for a night
Trying hard to break free, why won’t you just take me?
(Why won’t you just take me?)
[Chorus]
 Run and tell your mama things that I did to you
But I know you won’t tell her all the things you do
Trying so damn hard to hide, acting so brand new
Disappointed, not surprised that we let this fall through
Go run and tell your mama
(Run and tell your mama)
