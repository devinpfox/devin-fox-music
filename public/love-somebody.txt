[VERSE]
Yeah, you know I'm feelin' good
Yeah, you know I'm feelin' fine
Blessed me like an angel would
Now my life's alright

[CHORUS]
Don’t try to fight it
There ain’t nothing you can do about it
With your arms around me
Crazy how it feels when it’s real and you love somebody
Don’t try to fight it
There ain’t nothing you can do about it
With your arms around me
Crazy how it feels when it’s real and you love somebody
