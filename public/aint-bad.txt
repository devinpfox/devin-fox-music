[Verse]
I ain’t bad, but the bad don’t fuck with me
Here on the West Coast, that’s how you gotta be
Ain’t nobody lookin’ out for you
Gotta hit a quick L — lights out, boom boom
Ain’t no secret to the fortune or fame
Gotta fake it ’til you make it, yeah the game is pretty lame
[Pre-Chorus]
I ain’t bad, but the bad don’t — tell me, tell me
[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me, is it beautiful?
This rich and famous lifestyle
Why would you ever let it go
Consuming every inch of my soul
[Post-Chorus]
I ain’t bad but the bad don’t fuck with me — I ain’t bad but the bad don’t — (tell me, tell me)
I ain’t bad but the bad don’t fuck with me… lights out, boom boom!
